# Java ME GPS tracker

## Goals
To create a GPS tracker for simple phones that is usable in specific conditions:
- low visibility (poor light, phone stored in the handle bar holder or in a backpack)
- low GPS signal (need to wait long for GPS location to be obtained)
- limited ability to use the keyboard (wet hands, wearing gloves)

## Application characteristics
- clear user interface allowing to operate the application in poor conditions (big, clear information on the screen, usage of sound)
- ability to connect to various workout application servers (Endomondo, Strava, RunKeeper, etc.)

## How to contribute
- The most important thing at the moment is to test this application running on various hardware.
- All remarks about the user interface are very helpful.
- Application behaviour on long distances is a mystery at the moment.
